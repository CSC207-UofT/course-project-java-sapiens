# Project Accessibility Report

### Our current implementation and plan for future implementation for each principle of universal design.

- 1. Equitable Use: The two of users using our app, both the delivery man and customer all have similar looking UIs so that there doesn't exist any discrimination. There's also no advantages provided if you choose to spend extra money in our app, so this allows all the users to be on equal playing field. We also provide password hashing to all users in the Database, so all users have the same level of privacy. 

- 2. Flexibility in Use: We don't have features that follow this principle. But since our app allows travelers who just entered the country to stay in quarantine while still having access to buy things from stores and outlets, we could implement more world wide languages into our app. This allows for people who don't read english fluently to still be able to use our app. 

- 3. Tolerance for Error: We implemented regular expression checks for user information that the user can set for themselves. This catches users from entering invalid data such as phone numbers or car license plates in wrong formats. This is a fail safe feature that prevents the users from not being able to contact each other due to having the invalid contact information. We could also implement a message verification feature that verifies the phone number actually belongs to each user.  

### Our target users that we could market our program toward. 

Our program allows for a delivery men to buy and delivery anything to you. The types of users who could benefit from this are people who are too lazy or don't have time to go outside and buy things for themselves, and people with can't go outside due to either being stuck in quarantine or having disabilities. They can benefit from the simplicity of using our program and also that our app allows items from multiple stores to be bought in one order, which in turn saves them time and trouble.  

### Why our program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. 

Since due limitations of our program and the limitations of our connects, we can't get stores and outlets to partner with our app. This means that delivery men using our program having to physically go to each store to buy each item from the customer's shopping list. This would makes the delivery fee to be very high, which would limit our users.
