## Open questions our group is struggling with:
- How to get data from the Entities without breaking clean architecture and without implementing duplicate getter methods in the Use Cases that manage the Entities.
- Assigning functionality to Managers and Entities as per what best suits their functionality.

## What has worked well so far with our design:
- Our design provided good user feedback in the sense that the user can easily see and interact with the data they have created.
- Our design of seperating the text UI by how they will be implemented as activities in Android Studios would save time when we transition from our currerent text UI to an Android application.

## New Features that we will continue to develop after phase 2:
- Customers can choose their favoriate delivery man based on delivery man's rating and distance.
- Customers could edit their profile after they register.
- Display the google map to a customer, so the customer can know the current location of deliveryman.

## Summary of each group member's contributions in phase 2 and a link to their significant pull requests. 
- Kevin: Completed 4 Activities and fixed Clean Architecture violations from Phase 1. Significant pull request: https://git.io/JMpZR, this pull request included the creation to completion of two Activities that allows the User to create and modify their shopping list. Each Activity also uses a custom RecyclerView Adapter. 
- Patrick: Completed three activities and add JUnit tests. The first major request (https://git.io/JMpZd) is to finish Customer Profile Activity that when a user clicks button of profile from Customer Activity, they can display userâ€™s information from previous activity. The second major request (https://git.io/JMpGZ) is to work on DeliveryMan Rating Activity that delivery man can rate their customer and the purpose of the rate is to sort the customer based on it. Therefore, Deliverymen can choose a customer's order next time based on the rating score and distance.
