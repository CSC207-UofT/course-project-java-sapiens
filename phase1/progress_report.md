## Open questions your group is struggling with:
- How to get data from the Entities without breaking clean architecture and without implementing duplicate getter methods in the Use Cases that manage the Entities. 
- Assigning functionality to Managers and Entities as per what best suits their functionality.

## What has worked well so far with your design:
- Our design provided good user feedback in the sense that the user can easily see and interact with the data they have created. 
- Our design of seperating the text UI by how they will be implemented as activities in Android Studios would save time when we transition from our currerent text UI to an Android application.
