### A description of any major design decisions your group has made (along with brief explanations of why you made them).
We decided to continue with a text based UI for phase 1 since most of our group members are still learning Android Studio. But we implemented our text UI completely differently from phase 0. We modeled our text UI based on how we plan to implement the UI in Android Studio, with different activities classes in the UI layer of our program. This way when we work in Android, we re-use most of the code we used in phase 1 for the text UI.
